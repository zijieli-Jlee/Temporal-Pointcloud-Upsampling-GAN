### Training
We provide the pretrained model and example bash command to train the model under the folder ```train_novel``` and ```train_vel```.
To adapt the code for other data format, please refer to the tempo_dataset.py for details on the dataset.

### Generation
In the ```demo.ipynb```, we provide an example on how to use trained model to generate high-resolution reconstruction sequences from input.
To run the example in the demo, please first download the coarse simulation data from [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yENwLLFTMuoupzqyPYaQImdmFRmcbCxk/view?usp=sharing)
and put it under ```data``` folder in the base directory.
